## About

Hello! My name is Patrick, and I am a DevOps engineer deeply interested

### This Project

This website is an implementation of the
[Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). As part of this,
this static website using Next.js is hosted in an S3 bucket. The hit counter
uses API Gateway, Lambda functions programmed in Go, and a DynamoDB table.
All of this is deployed using Terraform and automated and tested using
GitHub Actions for CI/CD. You can read more about the project by reading
my [blog posts](/posts).
